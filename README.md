# Gilbert Random Graph Plotter (G(n, p))

This Scala program generates **Gilbert random graphs** based on parameters \( n \) (number of nodes) and \( p \) (edge creation probability). It calculates the **average path length** for graphs of varying sizes and visualizes these results with:
1. A **linear plot** (average path length vs. number of nodes).
2. A **log-log plot** (average path length vs. number of nodes with both axes on a logarithmic scale).
